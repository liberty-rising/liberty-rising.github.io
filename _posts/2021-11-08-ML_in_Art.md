# Machine Learning in Art
## Specifically as a musical artist
Seeing how ML demonstrates high performance in assigning captions to photos, it may be possible to create a model that generates thoughtful captions to match an artists aesthetic. This of course will require a good database to pull from and I believe such a database does not exist yet at the moment. If I go ahead and take on this project, I will likely have to create the database myself.
